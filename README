Conway's Game of Life
Cellular Automata Simuation
In memory of John Horton Conway's passing on 11th April, 2020

Rules:
- live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on, else dies.
- dead cell with 3 live neighbours lives.

Comments:
- run on both unix or windows OS
- randomized initialization
- flashing the display screen is kinda slow for different OS
